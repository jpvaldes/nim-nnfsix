# Nim version of neural networks from scratch

This code is my attempt at implementing [Neural Networks from Scratch
tutorials](https://github.com/Sentdex/NNfSiX) in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org).

This repository was meant as a learning exercise.  For any serious machine
learning project better look at a well developed library like
[Arraymancer](https://mratsim.github.io/Arraymancer/).
